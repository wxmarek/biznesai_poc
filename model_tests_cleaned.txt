Test Name: Probe Activation and Initialization Check
Steps:
1. Launch the ultrasound probe simulator in the testing software (e.g., virtual environment).
2. Simulate connecting the probe to a USB port (or another interface).
3. Check the simulator logs to see if there is a message indicating that the device has been successfully detected.
4. Verify the probe status in the simulator: confirm default parameters are set (e.g., frequency, gain).
5. In the ultrasound application, read the status to confirm it shows a successful initialization.

Expected Result:
- The probe is visible in the simulator and in the application as "online."
- No initialization errors in the logs and no warning messages.

### 
Test Name: Probe Detection by the System (USB 2.0 / 3.0)
Steps:
1. Launch the ultrasound probe simulator and the test application.
2. In the simulator, select the "USB 2.0" mode and simulate connecting the device.
3. Verify in the application whether a "Probe detected" message appears (device ID, driver name).
4. Disconnect the simulator, switch it to "USB 3.0" mode, and simulate the connection again.
5. Verify once more in the application that the probe is correctly detected when using USB 3.0.

Expected Result:
- The system correctly detects the probe in both USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 modes.
- The ultrasound application displays the correct device information in both cases.

### 
Test Name: Changing Operating Frequency (2 MHz, 10 MHz)
Steps:
1. In the simulator, start the probe with a default frequency (e.g., 5 MHz).
2. In the test application, select the option to change the frequency to 2 MHz.
3. Observe if the simulator confirms the change (log: "Frequency set to 2 MHz") and if the application displays the new image.
4. Switch the frequency to 10 MHz and again check the simulator logs and the image preview.
5. Check if there are no interruptions in transmission or error messages when switching between 2 MHz and 10 MHz.

Expected Result:
- The probe correctly switches between 2 MHz and 10 MHz.
- The image quality changes according to the selected frequency without losing transmission.
- No frequency-switching errors appear in the logs.

###
Test Name: Changing Work Mode (B-Mode, M-Mode, Doppler)
Steps:
1. Launch the simulator with the probe in B-mode (default).
2. In the test application, switch to M-mode and check the simulator logs:
   - Expected log: "Mode switched to M-mode."
3. Examine the image in the application to see if it changes to the linear M-mode trace without artifacts.
4. Next, switch to Doppler mode (Color/PW) and check the simulator logs as well as image smoothness.
5. Switch between these modes multiple times, observing whether any delays or errors occur.

Expected Result:
- Modes switch without downtime, and the displayed image matches the selected mode.
- The simulator logs show a mode change with no errors.
- The application correctly updates the interface and working parameters.

###
Test Name: Adjusting Penetration Depth
Steps:
1. In the simulator, set the initial depth to 5 cm.
2. Launch the application and verify that it shows 5 cm depth in the parameters panel.
3. Change the depth to 15 cm from the application interface.
4. Observe whether the simulator logs "Depth set to 15 cm" and whether the displayed image in the application is rescaled accordingly.
5. Switch the depth multiple times (5, 10, 15 cm) to confirm the transitions are smooth and error-free.

Expected Result:
- The application always correctly displays the current depth.
- Changing the depth does not cause freezes, and the image scales according to the parameter.
- The simulator confirms each depth change in its logs.

###
Test Name: Gain Control Adjustment
Steps:
1. Launch the simulator with a default gain (e.g., 50%).
2. In the application, move the GAIN slider to the minimum value (e.g., 0%).
3. Check whether the on-screen image becomes noticeably dimmer and if the simulator logs "Gain=0%."
4. Increase the GAIN to the maximum value (e.g., 100%) and observe the change in brightness.
5. Test several intermediate values (e.g., 25%, 75%) to ensure the response is as expected.

Expected Result:
- Each GAIN value change is reflected in the simulator and the image without delay.
- No errors occur at extreme settings (0% and 100%).
- The application correctly shows the current gain level.

###
Test Name: Zoom Test (2x, 4x)
Steps:
1. Launch the simulator with the default zoom (1x).
2. In the application, select the zoom function and set it to 2x.
3. Verify in the simulator logs that "Zoom factor=2x" is displayed and that the image is noticeably magnified.
4. Switch the zoom to 4x and again evaluate the displayed image in the application and simulator logs.
5. Return to 1x and confirm that the image reverts to the default setting without errors.

Expected Result:
- The application correctly modifies the zoom factor (2x, 4x), and the image is magnified accordingly.
- Each change is confirmed in the simulator logs.
- No image distortion or error messages appear during repeated zoom changes.

###
Test Name: Auto-Optimize (Automatic Tuning)
Steps:
1. Launch the simulator with factory settings (Gain=50%, Depth=10 cm, Frequency=5 MHz).
2. In the test application, enable the "Auto-Optimize" mode.
3. Observe the simulator logs to see a series of messages adjusting parameters (e.g., "Gain=60%, Frequency=4.5 MHz").
4. Examine the final image quality: verify it becomes clearer and that the application shows updated parameters.
5. Disable "Auto-Optimize" and confirm that the parameters remain at their last set values, without reverting to defaults.

Expected Result:
- The auto-optimize feature improves image clarity.
- The parameters truly change in the simulator and are reflected in the application.
- No errors occur when enabling or disabling this feature.

###
Test Name: Measurement Functions (Distance, Area)
Steps:
1. In the simulator, load a reference object (e.g., a phantom with a known diameter).
2. In the application, use the distance measurement tool, marking two points on the phantom’s image.
3. Compare the measured result with the object’s real dimension, checking for discrepancies (within a set tolerance).
4. Then select the area measurement tool (mark a circle or another shape on the phantom).
5. Compare the computed result with the simulator’s reference value (e.g., 3.14 cm²).

Expected Result:
- Distance and area measurements match the simulator data within the established tolerance.
- The application does not produce errors or freeze during measurements.
- Results remain consistent when measuring the same region multiple times.

###
Test Name: Saving and Loading Images (JPEG/DICOM Format)
Steps:
1. Launch the simulator and set an example scene (e.g., spherical phantom).
2. In the application, click "Save Image" and choose the JPEG format.
3. Verify that the *.jpg file is created correctly (via simulator logs or the save directory).
4. Repeat the save process in DICOM format. Confirm the presence of metadata (Date, Patient ID) in the file, if the simulator supports it.
5. Attempt to load the saved files (JPEG and DICOM) back into the application and check if the image is displayed correctly.

Expected Result:
- Images in JPEG and DICOM formats are saved without errors.
- The DICOM file contains basic metadata (if supported by the simulator).
- Loading the files back produces the correct preview with no distortion.
